      Positioning elements in web development isn’t as easy as it seems. Things
      can get complicated as more elements come to the page. Therefore, it is
      essential to know how to use CSS for aligning elements. It will also save
      our time while coding. There are different ways/methods for positioning
      elements. Using Bootstrap is a good way, for example, but not all projects
      use Bootstrap. In this article, I will be explaining one of the ways of
      aligning elements with pure CSS: the position property. We can also use
      CSS Display property to align elements with values like flex, grid,
      inline-block etc. Check my other article about the Display property here.
